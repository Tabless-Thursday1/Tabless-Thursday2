                        your life! We have all been there. Tabs can multiple like rabbits and it takes no time at all.
                        Afraid to close your browser but your computer is
                        getting sluggish. Taking longer and longer to switch between pages. Other applications don't
                        want to start or wake up. Your pc fan just hit overdrive
                        and the hum no has you on the edge of your seat.
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane" id="green" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="green-tab">
                        <h3>Green App</h3>That fan kicking into overdrive? Have 16 million different tabs open and your
                        starting to feel that lag? Keep your tabs organized! Tabless Thursday allows you to put your
                        favorite sites into categories so you can easily re-visit them when you need to. Find a new site
                        but don't have time to look it over? Place it in the for 'For Later', or the 'Got ta get to'
                        sections and never loose it again! Keeping your tabs organized keeps them out of your ram. Your
                        computer doesn't have to keep track of them. Keeping them out of memory and using less
                        processing power. Leaving your machine a lean and powerful beast.
